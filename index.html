          <p>Hi! My name is Gina. I grew up in Southern Maryland, graduated from the University of Maryland with a Criminal Justice degree, and have been living in McLean, VA for the past 10 years. I started off my career in the Criminal Justice field working at INTERPOL and then the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Then I switched gears and fell into Human Resources. I've yet to feel fulfilled and satisfied in my various positions over the years and that's why I really started to dig deep into figuring out what exactly it is that I want to do. 

              <br><br>So far, web development has proven to be a bit of a challenge because of the insane amount of things there are to know, but I think that as time goes on, I'll be able to pick up more and more. Understanding the fundamentals and how everything works the way it does first will allow everything else to fall into place eventually. It's also comforting to know that even experienced developers have to utilitze "Google" too!
              
              <br><br>In my spare time, I enjoy going to the gym, going out to eat, movies, and spending time with friends and family. Although recently, most of my spare time has been dedicated to learning web development using as many resources as possible! </p>
